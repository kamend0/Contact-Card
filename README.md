# Contact Card App

This project was created by following along with Chris Blakely's guide, which can be found here:

And his great website, React Beginner Projects, which lead me to this is here:

Big thanks to Chris for the great guide and helping get my feet wet with React.

## What it does

Currently, it shows 10 random people's contact information, all of which are fake. They are pulled down from this API:

https://randomuser.me/api/

## Future plans

Hoping to continue building off of this project as a continued exercise to learn React. Here are my first couple of ideas:

* Get user input of number of contact details to pull.
* Allow user to build their own list of contacts.
* Allow the import and export of contacts in JSON format.
